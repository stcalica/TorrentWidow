# TorrentWidow

Automatically Downloads Torrents From Kickass Torrents ( and many more spiders for others too!) 

This requires a few things: 


Python 2.7 
Dependencies ( and for windows win32pai if done on windows 7 follow this to install: pip install pypi32api ) 
Deluge torrent client 



Coming Soon(in order of priority): 
Auto download magnet links using Deluge
Script for Linux(probably a cron as well) and a script for windows to automatically download and alert you when complete
Installation Script for Windows and Linux 
Client GUI to control your spiders 


Thanks to all the libraries I used!
Especially, 
Python 
Scrapy Project
