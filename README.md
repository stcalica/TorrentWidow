# TorrentWidow

Automatically Downloads Torrents From Kickass Torrents ( and many more spiders for others too!) 

---UPDATE April 13, 2015---

Requires Docker!
I dockerized this project so that all the main user has to get working is docker and then just run
	
	`docker-compose up -d`

that should get this scraping for torrents and auto downloading them in deluge. 




Written using: 

Python 2.7 
Dependencies ( and for windows win32pai if done on windows 7 follow this to install: pip install pypi32api ) 
Deluge torrent client 


Coming Soon(in order of priority): 
Auto download magnet links using Deluge
The ability to find torrents without a web scraper! (Use the way torrent seeders work to find the torrents I want) 


Thanks to all the libraries I used!
Especially, 
Python 
Scrapy Project
